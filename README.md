# ixd_2020_clubwebsite
Simple HTML and CSS website I made for an Interaction Design Methods class
<br>
I had to create a club for my school and make a website that memebers or users could use to get more information on the club
<br> 
This was my first time creating a website so please excuse any jankiness in the project
